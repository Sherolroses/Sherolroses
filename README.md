## About Me

I am a Bachelor of Science in Computing student at UNISA, passionate about technology and software development. While I am still building my professional experience, I am 100% eager to learn and grow in the field.  

Alongside my studies, I work as a Practice Manager at Dental and Ortho, assisting dentists, taking patient X-rays, managing bookings, answering calls, handling payments, and ordering stock. This experience has strengthened my organizational and problem-solving skills.  

I am currently learning C++, Python, SQL, and web development languages to strengthen my programming skills and expand my technical knowledge. I would love to learn even more from companies with no limitations, expanding my skills and experience.
